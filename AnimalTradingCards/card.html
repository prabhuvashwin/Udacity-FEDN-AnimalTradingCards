          <ul class="facts">
            <li class="fact"><strong><em>Giant pandas</em></strong> are black and white bears. In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains of <em>Central China</em></li>
            <li class="fact"><em>These guys are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</em></li>
            <li class="fact"><em>Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.</em></li>
            <li class="fact red"><strong><em>Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it’s estimated that only around 1,000 remain in the wild. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect them!</em></strong></li>
